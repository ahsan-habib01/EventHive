### 🔒 Security Middleware
#### This project uses custom middlewares to protect sensitive routes:

* `verifyJWT:` Verifies the Firebase ID token from the request header.

* `verifyAdmin:` Restricts access to Admin-only features.

* `verifyManager:` Ensures only Event Managers can host events.

#### Middleware flow:
```
Request → verifyJWT → verifyRole → Controller
```

### 🧪 Best Practices Followed

-  Modular route structure

-  Clean separation of concerns

-  Secure payment verification

-  Transaction-safe booking logic

-  Production-ready error handling
